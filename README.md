# Siemens rdb to JSON Parser
This project aims to create a parser, coverter and querying interface for batches of `.rdb` files generated by Siemens TIA portal or Wincc flexible runtime.  
The target output file should be a single `JSON` file, if file size allows, and provide a key- and field-querying function.

## Update
- The `.rdb` file appears to be some sort of unfamiliar SQLite database file instead of a Redis file.  
- Abandoning project due to lack of expertise until further notice.
